## What is Federated Learning?
**Federated Learning (FL)** is a privacy-first machine learning approach where model training happens **locally on user devices** without centralizing raw data.

- 📡 **Decentralized Training**: Devices like smartphones or sensors train models locally.
- 🔒 **Data Stays Local**: Only model updates (like gradients) are shared with the central server.

---

## Why is FL Important?
- 🔐 **Privacy**: Compliant with GDPR/CCPA; raw data never leaves the device.
- ⚡ **Efficiency**: Utilizes distributed computational power.
- 🌍 **Decentralization**: Reduces reliance on centralized systems.

---

## How FL Works
1. Server initializes a model.
2. Devices receive and train on local data.
3. Only updates are sent back.
4. Server aggregates updates.
5. The global model is updated.
6. Process repeats for better accuracy.

## Advantages vs. Traditional ML
| Federated Learning              | Traditional Machine Learning               |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Data remains on device         | Requires centralized data collection       |
| Reduces bandwidth              | High data transfer requirements            |
| Continuous local improvements  | Requires full retraining for updates       |

## 📡 Case Study: Vision Transmission in HAPS using FL

### 🎯 Objective
Use Federated Learning to **reduce bandwidth usage** and **preserve data quality** when transmitting vision data between HAPS and ground systems.

### 🧠 Core Concept
Rather than transmitting full images/videos:
- HAPS processes data locally using FL
- Only model insights/updates are sent to ground stations
- Ground systems reconstruct visual info using the global model

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview
1. **Local Vision Processing on HAPS**
   - Uses CNNs or vision transformers to process data locally.
2. **Federated Training**
   - Extract only critical information
3. **Model Updates**
   - Only gradients or learned features are sent to the central server.
4. **Aggregation & Feedback**
   - Central server aggregates updates and improves the global vision model.(Transmit insights and model updates rather than raw footage)
5. **Ground Reconstruction**
   - Ground systems reconstruct necessary visual details using updated models.(Reconstruct meaningful visual information on the ground)

### ✅ Benefits
- 🚀 Saves bandwidth
- 🔐 Preserves sensitive visual data
- 📊 Enables smarter onboard AI for real-time processing

---

## Conclusion
Federated Learning represents a **paradigm shift in machine learning**—favoring **privacy, decentralization, and efficiency**. Its integration into real-world systems like HAPS vision transmission shows how FL is shaping the future of **AI on the edge**.
